positioning property

 position : value ;
 values are 
 static : unchangable even though we apply left,right,top, bottom property it will not move.
 relative : changable 
            the element will move without dropping its original position
 absolute : when we apply this positioning property it will make the element free from the screen to move
             it will consider the screen, it can scrolled
 fixed : when we apply this property it will make the element in such a way that it can't be scrolled
         it consider screen as parent

 sticky : yeh property tb use hogi jb hme usko ek limit tk hi scrolled krvana ho
          ex : position: sticky;
               top: 0;
               here when the element will hit the top position it cant be scrolled.
 z-index : above the canvas/ground 
           if i want to overlap two elements and i want a element to be in front i will just make the z-index higher for that element.

    {property under this position except static}
     top :value;
     left : value;
     right : value;
     bottom : value;
