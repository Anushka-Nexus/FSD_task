String :- String is  a sequence of character.

In javascript there are various methods and properties which can be used to manipulate the strings.

String manipulation includes 
:- creating a string
updating
changing
accessing,etc.

Some properties are :-
 (1)Length :- With the help of js one can know the Length of the string .
              Function :-
                variable-name.length()
 
Some methods of manipulation are :-
   (1)Case :- With the help of js one can change the case of the string .
             It includes :-
             (i)variable.toUpperCase():- converts the string into to Upper Case

             (i)variable.toLowerCase():- converts the string into to Lower Case

   (2)Index :-With the index one can access the string in js.
        (i)Indexof :- It is a method used to find the position of the first occurrence of a specified value in a string
        (ii)LastIndexof:-It is similar to indexOf(), but it searches from the end of the string or array and returns the last occurrence    
                         of the specified value.
  
   (3)slice:- It is used to extract certain portion of the string.
          syntax:-
             variable.slice(start_value,end_value)
   (4)substring:- It can be used to divide the string in desired portion.
            syntax:-
                   variable.substring(start,end)
  
   (5)Replace :- With the help of js one can change the group of character from the string using replace Function.
            It includes:-
             (i)variable.replace("jisko change krna hai" "jisse change hoga") :- It replace first occurence of the string(desired group of char)

             (ii)variable.replaceAll("jisko change krna hai" "jisse change hoga") :- It replace first occurence of the string(desired group of char)
   
   //Difference between slice and substring
     Feature	                               slice()	                              substring()
      Negative numbers	                 Works (counts from end)	               Does not work (treats as 0)
      If start > end	                      Returns empty string	               Swaps the two values
      Example with negatives	            "Hello".slice(-3) → "llo"           	 "Hello".substring(-3) → "Hello"

  //Difference between index and position
    Index:
       It’s like a label or number assigned to something to tell where it is, usually starting from 0.
       
       Used mostly in computers and programming.
       
       Example: If you have a row of lockers numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 — the index tells you which locker.

    Position:
     It means the place or spot in an order, usually starting from 1.
     
     How people usually count naturally.
     
     Example: Saying “the 1st locker, 2nd locker, 3rd locker” — that’s position.

      program :-wap to count each character occurence    


()Template litrals :-Template literals are a way to work with strings in JavaScript, using backticks ( ` ) instead of quotes.
       example :- let name=`anu`

   When one wants to concatenate the string of the Template literals they can simply use ${}
       example:- console.log(`The name is ${name}`)

   It makes the concatenation less complicated.

()Regex :- 
   match():-
   test():-
   pattern is enclosed within the /anything inside this/
ex :-
let patern = (?=.*[0-9]?=.*[a-z]?=.*[A-z] .{8,10}$)
