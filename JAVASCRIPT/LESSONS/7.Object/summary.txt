Object 
:- An object is a way to store related data together in key-value pairs.

 Ex :- let person = {
       name: "Aman",
        age: 25,
        job: "Developer"
       };

       //important
       person is an object
       It has keys: name, age, job    
       Each key has a value

object format :-
 let object_name ={
       key:value pair
 }

//For accessing the object we will use member access operator  (.)

 format:- object_name.key
 Example :-
      console.log(person.name) //Aman
       console.log(person.age) //25

//Array of Object 
:-An array of objects is just a list of items, where each item is an object.
  Each object can hold multiple pieces of related data using key-value pairs.

   Think of it like a classroom:
   The array is the class.
   Each object is a student with their own details.

//Example:-
let students = [
  { name: "Rahul", age: 20, course: "FSD" },
  { name: "Priya", age: 22, course: "Java" },
  { name: "Amit", age: 21, course: "Python" }
]

üîπ What is Destructuring?
:-Destructuring means breaking apart an array or object and storing the values in variables directly.
  It's like unpacking a gift box into smaller, labeled boxes.

// Destructuring of Array and Objects
:-  
 let array = [1, 2, 3, 4]
 let object = { key1: "value1", key2: "value2" }
 let [a, b, c, d] = array
 console.log(a)
 console.log(d)

Example:-
 let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];

  let [a, b, c] = fruits;

  console.log(a); // apple
  console.log(b); // banana
  console.log(c); // mango

//Spread of operator
:- The spread operator (...) is like saying:
  ‚ÄúTake everything from this array or object and unpack it here.‚Äù
  It‚Äôs used to copy, merge, or expand arrays and objects.
  
Example:-
  console.log(...array)
