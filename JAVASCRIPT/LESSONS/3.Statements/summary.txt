Statements :-In JavaScript, a statement is an instruction that performs an action. Think of statements as the building blocks
             of your code that tell the browser what to do.

There are three types of statement:-
(1) Input/Output statement :- These are the statement which are used to take input from the user or used to display output from the user.
    
    Input statement:-
    window.prompt():-  
          Displays a dialog box asking the user to enter input.  
          Returns the input as a string.  
          If the user clicks Cancel, it returns null  
          ex:-let name = window.prompt("What is your name?");  (input statement)
             console.log(name); 

    Output statement :-
     console.log():- display the output in the console section
     window.alert() :- display the output message as a alert box to the user
     document.write() :- display the output in the document

(2)Conditional statement :- As the name suggest Conditional statement are those statement who depends on the condition for its execution.
                            There are various types of Conditional statement some are :-

            (i)If statement:- here only one condition is provided by the programmer if the condition of if-block gets satisfied then the 
                               if-block will executed otherwise the control will exited from the if block .
                    
                    Syntax :- If(condition){

                        //true block
                    }
            
            (ii)If-else statement:- here a condition is provided by the programmer if the condition of if-block gets satisfied then the 
                               if-block will executed otherwise the control will move to else block and there statements will executed .
                    
                    Syntax :- If(condition){

                        //true block
                    }
                    else{
                        //false block
                    }
             (iii)If-else-if statement:- here  a condition is provided by the programmer if the condition of if-block gets satisfied then the 
                               if-block will executed otherwise the control will move to else-if block  and if the else-if condition 
                               is satisfied then else-if block will executed and otherwise else-block statements will executed .
                    
                    Syntax :- If(condition){

                        //if block
                    }
                    else if(condition){
                        //else-if block
                    }
                    else{
                        //else block
                    }
                
                 (iv)Nested if statement:- here  a condition is provided by the programmer if the condition of if-block gets satisfied then it
                                           will move inside the if-block now here more than one conditions are given if all are satisfied then 
                                           the statement will finally executed.
                    Syntax :- If(condition){
                                  if(condition1){
                                     if(condition2)
                                  }
                             }
