LOOP
  
  Q.What is loop?
  :-loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly

  There are three general types of loops :-
    while loop
    do-while loop
    for loop(for-next,for-each loops)

 (1)While loop :- It is atype of loop which will repeatedly executed until the condition met.
     
     Syntax:- while(condition){
        //statements
        //updation condition it should be relevant 
     }


    

     ex:- wap using while loop to print even numbers from 0 to 100
     let num1=0
     while(num1 <=100){
        if(num1%2==0){
            console.log(num1)
        }
        num1++
     }

    
   
  (2)Do-while loop :-Do-while loop is a type of control statement which will executed atleast once without checking if the condition
                     even met or not (for the first time).
                     And then from the 2nd iteration it will check the condition if the condition is satisfy then it will execute the block.

      Syntax :- Do{
              //statement
              //updation
      }while(condition);

      

   (3)For-loop :- It is a type of iterative loop which will be repeatedly executed until the condition is satisfied.

   Syntax :-
            for(initialize ; condition ; updation){
               //statement
            }
