LOOP
  
  Q.What is loop?
  :-loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly

  There are three general types of loops :-
    while loop
    do-while loop
    for loop(for-next,for-each loops)

 (1)While loop :- It is atype of loop which will repeatedly executed until the condition met.
     
     Syntax:- while(condition){
        //statements
        //updation condition it should be relevant 
     }


     ex:- wap to print a factorial of a number.

     let num=4
     let ans=1
     while(num>0){
        fact=fact*num
        num--
     }
     console.log("Factorial is :-" +fact)

     ex:- wap using while loop to print even numbers from 0 to 100
     let num1=0
     while(num1 <=100){
        if(num1%2==0){
            console.log(num1)
        }
        num1++
     }

     ex :- wap to print odd numbers 1 to 70
     let number=1
      while(number <=100){
        if(number%2!=0){
            console.log(number)
        }
        number++
     }

     ex :- add of number,armstrong,palindrome, prime in range 
  (2)
