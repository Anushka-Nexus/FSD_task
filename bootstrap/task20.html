             <div class="mt-2 ms-4 fs-5">  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here’s one thing that DCU fans don’t have to worry about: Regardless of what kind of reviews Superman gets, 
                   it’s going to have a strong opening weekend at the box office. The Hollywood Reporter is predicting around
                   a $135 million opening in the United States, while other outlets are predicting even more.
                   It’s a highly anticipated movie with recognizable characters and IP draw, and those who want to see it 
                   surely going to rush out to do so as soon as possible.Whether or not Superman can have legs at the box office
                   in the following weeks is what’s going to really matter.
                  Unlike something like Jurassic World Rebirth, Superman
                  is not critic-proof. This is the start of a new franchise, and word-of-mouth is going to be key. Just appealing 
                  to the comic fans won’t cut it.
