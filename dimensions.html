         &nbsp; <span>Puppies are soft, cute, funny, and make a big mess. 
         Every month or two our family fosters 6-12 week old puppies for a puppy rescue nonprofit organization. 
          We all enjoy cuddling their furry bodies after a clean bath.
         Fresh puppy smell is great. The puppies play with each other and our adult dog.
          They look so funny when they lay on top of each other and sleep.
           While puppies can be great fun, they also can make big messes.
           4-6 puppies can make a lot of puppy pee and poop.
            It's a challenge to keep the puppies and the puppy pen clean. </span>

             anything close to what it should have been. They all blankly looked at each wondering how this could have happened.
              In their minds, they all began to blame the other members of the group as to why they had failed.
              Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. 
              There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house.</span>

           <br><br> Dragons don't exist they said. They are the stuff of legend and people's imagination.
             Greg would have agreed with this assessment without a second thought 24 hours ago.
              But now that there was a dragon staring directly into his eyes, he questioned everything that he had been told.
             It wasn't supposed to end that way. The plan had been meticulously thought out and practiced again and again. 
             There was only one possible result once it had been implemented, but as they stood there the result wasn't 
             anything close to what it should have been. They all blankly looked at each wondering how this could have happened.

            Out of another, I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. 
            There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking
             in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least. He says
              that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all
               manner of excited fancies and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency. So I try.
